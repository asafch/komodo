# Jupiter - a robotics and computer vision project

We use the Komodo robot to find and grab all red balls in a room.

Please refer to the [final report](https://github.com/asafch/komodo/blob/master/Jupiter%20Final%20Report.pdf) for further information.

You can see a short (~2 mins) intro video in Hebrew [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtKnoQu_9Ho) and a demonstration video (~4.5 mins) of the robot [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GswU1YVCJvo).
